## Phantom ðŸ‘»

### Hunting
- **Speed**: Normal (`1.6 m/s`)
- **Blink Rate**: Exhibits extended periods of invisibility during hunts, making it especially difficult to see. When it does appear, it's for a much shorter duration than other ghosts. `[H]`

### Strengths and Weaknesses
- **Strengths**: Sets a path to a player and leaves an EMF level 2 reading at the start of its path.
- **Weaknesses**: Disappears when photographed during ghost events and potentially hunts as well.

### Hunting
- **Speed**: Normal (`1.6 m/s`). This ghost will Speed up over time during the hunt.
- **Target Selection**: As soon as the house door is unlocked, the Banshee selects a single player as its primary target. This target remains fixed unless the player either dies or leaves the game. If the chosen target isnt in line of sight, the Banshee will temporarily switch its focus to another player until the initial target re-enters the house.
- **Sanity**: Hunts triggered by the sanity level of the chosen target, starting at 50% or lower.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths and Weaknesses
- **Strengths**: Lowers player sanity by 2% when close. Cannot turn off the breaker but can overload it by activating multiple lights, causing the breaker to trip.
- **Weaknesses**: Loses effectiveness if the electrical breaker is off.

### Interactions
- **Electrical Behavior**: Produces an EMF level 2 reading near the breaker when in proximity to players.
- **Breaker Interaction**: The Jinn will not manually turn off the breaker. However, it can cause it to trip by turning on lights throughout the house. You can distinguish this from a manually turned-off breaker by checking the position of the light switches. If they are in the 'off' position, the breaker was tripped, potentially indicating a Jinn.
