## Spirit ðŸ‘»

### Hunting
- **Speed**: Normal (`1.6 m/s`)
- **No-Hunt Timer**: Extended to 180 seconds (3 minutes) when using a Smudge Stick.

## Wraith ðŸ‘»

### Hunting
- **Speed**: Normal (`1.6 m/s`)
- **Behavior**: Cannot teleport during hunts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
- **Strengths**: Teleports to/near players and leaves an EMF reading at the teleport point. `[H]`
- **Weaknesses**: Rarely touches the ground, making it immune to Salt. Use Motion Sensors above Salt for easy detection.

### Interactions
- **Spirit Box**: Highly responsive.
- **Post-Teleport Behavior**: Returns to its preferred room after teleporting.


## Phantom ðŸ‘»

### Hunting
- **Speed**: Normal (`1.6 m/s`)
- **Blink Rate**: Exhibits extended periods of invisibility during hunts, making it especially difficult to see. When it does appear, it's for a much shorter duration than other ghosts. `[H]`

### Strengths and Weaknesses
- **Strengths**: Sets a path to a player and leaves an EMF level 2 reading at the start of its path.
- **Weaknesses**: Disappears when photographed during ghost events and potentially hunts as well.

### Interactions
- **Photographic Evidence**: If a photo label reads "Ghost," the Phantom will not be visible in the photograph.


## Poltergeist ðŸ‘»

### Hunting
- **Speed**: Normal (`1.6 m/s`)
- **Object Throwing**: Capable of rapidly throwing multiple objects simultaneously during hunts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
- **Strengths**: Throws objects with extreme force and reduces player sanity by 2% for each object thrown. `[H]`

### Interactions
- **Object Throwing**: Guarantees object throwing every 0.5 seconds if objects are nearby, making it highly active in cluttered environments.


## Banshee ðŸ‘»

### Hunting
- **Speed**: Normal (`1.6 m/s`)
- **Target Selection**: As soon as the house door is unlocked, the Banshee selects a single player as its primary target. This target remains fixed unless the player either dies or leaves the game. If the chosen target steps outside the house, the Banshee will temporarily switch its focus to another player until the initial target re-enters the house.
- **Sanity**: Hunts are initiated only based on the sanity level of the chosen target, beginning when it drops to 50% or lower.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
- **Strengths**: Drains 15% of the player's sanity during specific events.
- **Weaknesses**: Frequently engages in singing events, which makes it easier to identify. Note: This does not apply during hunts.

### Interactions
- **Sound Behavior**: 30% chance to emit a scream detectable via the Para Mic.
- **Roaming**: Actively roams towards its chosen target, making it more predictable in its movements.


## Jinn ðŸ‘»

### Hunting
- **Speed**: Moves at a normal speed of `1.6 m/s` when out of line of sight, but will return to normal speeds when close to a player. When the Jinn spots its target, the speed accelerates to `2.5 m/s` when the Jinn sees its target and maintains line of sight.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
- **Strengths**: Lowers player sanity by 2% when close. Cannot turn off the breaker but can overload it by activating multiple lights, causing the breaker to trip.
- **Weaknesses**: Loses effectiveness if the electrical breaker is off.

### Interactions
- **Electrical Behavior**: Produces an EMF level 2 reading near the breaker when in proximity to players.
- **Breaker Interaction**: The Jinn will not manually turn off the breaker. However, it can cause it to trip by turning on lights throughout the house. You can distinguish this from a manually turned-off breaker by checking the position of the light switches. If they are in the 'off' position, the breaker was tripped, potentially indicating a Jinn.
